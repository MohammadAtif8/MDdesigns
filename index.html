          <span class="title-project">ABOUT ME (1996)</span>
          <p>Twenty-seven years ago I saw the first light of day. In my early days I spent a good deal amount of time being creative; drawing and glueing all over the place. Over the years I developed a questionably healthy interest and curiosity towards computers, with video games in particular. I was always wondering how they were made, and spent more time in level editors than playing the actual games. That curiosity turned me into what I am today, a creative professional yet still eager to learn more tricks of the trade.</p>
            <p>Coming to my education I received my bachelor's degree CSE &amp; Development (with honours) at the Rungta Engineering College - Bhilai. After graduating I shifted to Hyderabad and got my First opputunity at Pole To Win(2019). In 2022 i joined Tiny Tactics as Game Level designer.</p>
            <p>I've learnt many things along the way, gathered new insights and different perspectives. New engines, new tools, met new people, improved my scripting abilities. In my spare time I sometimes work on personal projects, varying from commercial projects to small hobby projects - either way I'm always learning.</p><img alt="" class="rsTmb" src="images/newatif.jpg">

          <p><span class="label gamedesign">Game Design</span><span class="label leveldesign">Level Design</span></p>
          <p>For this strategic match-3 based puzzle game I had to work on the level design. It was important to come up with mechcanics that could interact with each other and serve multiple purposes, to maximize puzzle potential. When designing the levels itself, I prepared an entire list of key feature as to what makes a good match-3 level. And with those key feature setting in mind, developed the levels with assets and turning it into a real design captivating and engross an delightful experience for the player!</p>

          <p>For Funtown I designed waves of gameplay and constructed parts of the level with the blockers and items made by the artists. This was an iterative process, i had to fine-tune the levels using the Live Data presented to me in the form of sheet.</p>
